**Space'Chat** is a real-time application providing chat and multi-editing features (_i.e. Google Docs_) throughout an appealing UI. It is made in full JavaScript using **React/Redux/Saga x Styled-Components** for the frontend and **Node/Express/Socket.io** for the backend.

## Run the project

Run the the following command `npm i` in both directories **chat-back** and **chat-front** ton install the project dependencies. To run the server, `nodemon server.js` in the **backend folder** and `npm start` in the **frontend folder** to run the client.

That is it!
